# Hi, hello!

This is a css test with the **Magic: The Gathering** cards, really proud of the results but could do better
with some extra time. Anyway, let's go do the important things.

## First, how did you get those images and stuff?

To be honest - most of the cards are all from google.com and i had to search for them individually everytime.
BUT -- they look cool eh? Except for the logo, that i used **leonardo.ai** to make it by myself.

## And the languages?

Honestly, css and html are the mains here - since i didn't even used js - but i thought of something with javascript
that i would like to try after this project is rated by my teacher. Anyway - that's basically it! Hope you like it <3

> By the way - the concept of cards are all from Magic, i used a few sites & inspirations that i found on google,
just like the [ronniemon](https://github.com/ronniemon/mtg-card-html) repository.
